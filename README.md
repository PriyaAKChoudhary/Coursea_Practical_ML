# Coursea_Practical_ML
Coursera's Data Science Specialization, Practical Machine Learning's project, Prediction Assignment Writeup.
# Project Info
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the classe variable in the training set. Use any of the other variables to predict with.

Create a report describing how to build the model, how to use cross validation, what the expected out of sample error is, and why make the choices. Then use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

The submission should consist of a link to (this) Github repo with the R markdown and compiled HTML file describing the analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders to submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online.
